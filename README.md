## Hi there, I'm Giancarlo!

I'm a CS/Math dual undergraduate at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute. I'm currently most comfortable with python, with my specialty being webscraping with beautiful soup and selenium. I use these to write scraping scripts for two websites related to degree planning at RPI, YACS and HASSPathways.

To Learn:

I'm currently not comfortable writing frontends or backends for websites (my data collecting doesn't really count), as most of my coursework has dealt with programming basics/algorithms, which is a good foundation but not strictly applicable yet. I would also like to learn how to implement a neural network in python, as I find myself coming up with projects sometimes which would be made easier with a machine learning/neural network element.

If you want my help on any projects feel free to reach out:
