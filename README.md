## Hi there, I'm Giancarlo!

I'm a CS/Math dual undergraduate at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute. I'm currently most comfortable with python, with my specialty being webscraping with beautiful soup and selenium. I use these to write scraping scripts for two websites related to degree planning at RPI, YACS and HASSPathways. I additionally rewrote much of the HASSPathways frontend/backend for HASSPathwaysV2. I'm currently working on Submitty.

To Learn:

Databases, LLM/Machine Learning, php
